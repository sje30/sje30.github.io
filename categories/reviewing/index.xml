      <description>Since 2018, I no longer review manuscripts that are under consideration for publication in hybrid journals. Hybrid journals (where a subscription-based journal charges the author an extra amount to make their article open access) have become increasingly popular in the last few years as a way for journals to meet open access mandates.
However, rather than being a temporary measure, these charges are currently part of the mainstream publishing process. These extra OA charges lead to accusations of &amp;lsquo;double dipping&amp;rsquo;, where academics are paying twice: first for the library to subscribe, second for the author to publish.</description>
