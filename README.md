2025 version of website started, using Quarto.


## TODO

1. Bring auto darkmode https://github.com/gadenbuie/quarto-auto-dark

Done.  This is very neat.  Allows the website to flick from night to
day mode, following the operating system.  e.g. on Macs, there is an
"appearance" setting that can go from light to dark.

2. favicon in web and standalone content

I generated the favicon using https://favicon.io/

## Previewing and Building

The command "quarto render" will build the website.
"git push" is separately needed to push the edits to github. 

The command "quarto preview" (also "make preview") will allow a live
preview.

The command "quarto publish" does the render and commit to github.


```sh
quarto render
```
