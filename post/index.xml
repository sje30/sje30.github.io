      <description>Every year I give a one-hour lecture introducting LaTeX to mathematics undergraduates and Masters students. After the lecture, I normally host a lab session for students to work through some material. In 2020, there is no physical lab session I&amp;rsquo;m afraid&amp;hellip;
Slides The slides for the talk are, of-course, written in LaTeX using the Beamer package. The source code for the files are available on github.
Lab material I&amp;rsquo;ve written a short template file for students to adopt when writing their own reports.</description>

      <description>We have been making good progress on the CODECHECK project.
We have created a corpus of certificates, which are available on Zenodo Our first &amp;rsquo;live&amp;rsquo; certificate for the journal Gigascience was created. See blog pieces: 1 and 2. We have been busy replicating findings from COVID papers. Update: this has now been reported in this Nature news item. Stay tuned for more developments! Follow us along on github.</description>

      <title>Reviewing papers in hybrid journals</title>

      <description>Since 2018, I no longer review manuscripts that are under consideration for publication in hybrid journals. Hybrid journals (where a subscription-based journal charges the author an extra amount to make their article open access) have become increasingly popular in the last few years as a way for journals to meet open access mandates.
However, rather than being a temporary measure, these charges are currently part of the mainstream publishing process. These extra OA charges lead to accusations of &amp;lsquo;double dipping&amp;rsquo;, where academics are paying twice: first for the library to subscribe, second for the author to publish.</description>

      <title>In praise of timers</title>

      <description>Here are speaker timers for the CCBI symposiums. For the 40 and 60 minute talks, ten minutes before the end of the time slot, the background changes from green to orange (with one bell). With five minutes to go, the background changes to red (with two bells). At the end of the time slot, three bells sound, and we should move onto the next talk. (For the twenty minute talks, the splits are 16/2/2 mins).</description>

      <description>Journals today mostly publish our academic papers as PDFs. This is great for us, as we can easily store most of our papers locally on our harddrives, rather than relying on a physical copy of each paper. However, managing such a collection of PDFs quickly becomes cumbersome. Many software solutions are available for managing your PDFs. One application that I&amp;rsquo;ve found very useful is Paperpile. There is a snappy 2 1/2 minute video that shows it in action:</description>

      <description>[The following was written for the British Neuroscience Association]
A brief introduction to reproducible research and open science
At first glance, it might seem odd that you would need to prefix the term &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; with the qualifier &amp;ldquo;reproducible&amp;rdquo;. Surely, once you have a paper in your hands, you have all the details in front of you to reproduce someone else&amp;rsquo;s work? That&amp;rsquo;s certainly the theory when writing the paper, but it&amp;rsquo;s often not the practice&amp;hellip; Since 2004 we&amp;rsquo;ve set a problem for our masters students to reproduce key results from a paper within computational biology.</description>

      <description>For a few years I&amp;rsquo;ve given a workshop, a two hour introduction to computational neuroscience, for masters students. This has covered the Hodgkin-Huxley model of action potential generation, reduced models, and simple small-networks. Most of the content was previously matlab code, provided by other researchers, most notably Hugh Wilson and Eugene Izhikevich.
Over the last few months, we (mostly Derek Fulton and Paraskevi Mylona) have converted this matlab code to the Julia programming language.</description>

      <title>Towards standard practice for sharing of code and data in neuroscience</title>
      <link>/2017/05/25/towards-standard-practice-for-sharing-of-code-and-data-in-neuroscience/</link>

      <description>Scientists are increasingly dependent on computational techniques to analyse large volumes of data. These computational methods are often tailored to the particular analysis in mind, and as such are valuable research outputs. Furthermore, unlike experimental techniques, computational methods can be easily shared. However, at least in neuroscience, computational methods are not routinely shared upon publication of associated manuscripts.
To improve this situation, we have worked with the editors of Nature Neuroscience to establish a pilot code review project.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc. There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>On behalf of all the editors, I am pleased to announce the release of our special issue on the Quantitative Analysis of Neuroanatomy. All articles have been published in Frontiers in Neuroanatomy. As of March 2016, all papers are now freely available as an Ebook either in PDF or EPUB format.
The aim of this Research Topic is to examine theoretical and experimental work directed at a detailed and comprehensive quantitative understanding of neuroanatomy.</description>

      <description>On 7-9 December 2015, we hosted maps2015 in Strasbourg, France. The primary aim of the meeting was to bring together the two communities of theoreticians and experimentalists working on related problems in developmental neurobiology. This was the second meeting that we have hosted on this topic, following on from maps2014.org in Edinburgh. This year the programme took a slightly wider scope: although most talks were related to the development and order in brain maps, we also had several interesting talks including mouse and zebrafish behaviour.</description>
